Since its debut on the technology market, Golang (Google’s Go Programming Language) has proved to be a robust and popular option to write APIs and create web-based services. Most users are inclined to use Golang, one of the most popular programming languages, immediately following the launch.

After a series of surveys, nearly 90% of respondents decided to take on Golang in the next round of projects. In terms of distinctive capabilities and features, and as a superior choice, Golang has ranked the most powerful framework in all web-based programming languages. In addition to creating APIs, developers also utilize Goland frameworks to create a REST API.

In a few ways, we have found that Beego is similar to the comprehensive Django web framework that was designed for Python. It provides a unique set of functions and features that are typical of web-based applications. Furthermore, it is divided into eight different modules that can be eliminated or utilized depending on the need.

In addition to the broad-ranging MVC components that appear in the most popular web applications, the framework also contains the ORM (Object-Relationship Map) to allow access to information, tools for managing sessions as well as an in-built cache handler. Additionally, it comprises libraries that support joint operation as well as HTTP components, elements, and a variety of log systems.

Beego is yet another method that is indicative of Django with its various command-line tools. For example, a developer can utilize the bee command to create Beego applications from scratch or work with existing apps.

7. Mango

Mango framework helps you build and develop modules that are reusable for HTTP functionality as easily and quickly as possible. Additionally, it provides an array of software and middleware that can be combined into one HTTP server object that can be used to sustain your code in a self-directed manner.

8. Gocraft

Another solid yet old-fashioned framework is Gocraft which provides fast and flexible routing features. Routing is added as a feature by its HTTP and net program in The benchmark library. It’s a Go mux-based middleware application with casting and reflection capabilities, allowing you to write your application code statically.

In addition, you can build your own or add features using the existing middleware. Since programmers have the highest priority for the performance of their applications, Gocraft is a great choice for those who need to create their own. Additionally, it’s simple to write and create backend web applications using Gocraft framework.

9. Web.go

Web.go is very light at the top of the list, and falls in the category of Google’s most basic Golang web-based frameworks.
